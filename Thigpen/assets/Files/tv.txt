Reality TV Shows	Why are you watching this crap? Seriously, why? What is wrong with you? You have failed as a human being.
Sitcoms 	Does anyone ever actually watch sitcoms? Like, I can't even name any off the top of my head. At all.
Anime	Just Stop
Crime Shows	We know no one really talks about these, but we figured we'd throw you a bone.
Black Television	We'll leave the description to you.
Comedy	Suit Up.
Drama	Apparently, you care about this. We will judge. Harshly.
Suspense/Thriller	What exactly qualifies as suspense? That's not a genre. You're not having Suspense. Are you just typing everything I said? I'll take that as a yes. But, seriously. Can we take out suspense?
Superhero Television	Starring Harrison Wells, Superwom...girl, The Red Flash (The Second Fastest Man Alive), Arrow (No), and Phil *The Coul* Son
